All the logs on this website are part of a continuously evolving process of me trying to note down as much stuff as possible. The start date for logs keeping is 01-01-2021.

<h2>Why do I log?</h2>
I feel that life is too long for my brain to remember all of its details, but it is too short to forget them. Logging stuff is my attempt to preserve memorable moments in my life and relive them as much as possible.

<h2>How I got here?</h2>
The initial goal when I started logging in was to create a memex, with all the details of life. I had built a system for this as well, which was able to generate good-looking charts showing how much I walked, daily water intake, which project did I work on that day, etc. After meticulously logging almost everything for three months, I realized this was not sustainable. So I only continued logging most normal stuff like movies and trips.

<h2>What is the rating system?</h2>
I usually rate most of the entries between 5 to 10. I had started the rating process assuming I will rate everything from 1-10, but I never really used anything below 5. It felt too harsh on creators who have put in non-zero efforts to create it. Here is a brief description of how I usually feel about these ratings as the perception does change from person to person.
<ul style="list-style:none">
<li>5.  bad
<li>6. subpar
<li>7. Okok
<li>8. Good but I didn't feel strongly about it / lacking in some respect 
<li>9. Great but not GOAT
<li>10. GOAT
</ul>
