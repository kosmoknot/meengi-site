Karnataka is home to many natural monuments and archeological sites left by past empires. Relics from the empires of Chalukyas of Badami, the Vijaynagar empire of Hampi, and the Hoysala empire of Halebidu are especially stunning; telling of their past glories and lasting cultural influence. Of these three empires, Hoysalas (11th to 14th centuries) are remembered for their patronage of architectural endeavors rather than their military conquest. Most of the temples they built are currently in ruins except for a handful.
<br><br>
Most of these sites are located near Belur which was the first destination of our trip. While on the way to Belur from Hassan, the province capital, we stopped at the Doddagadduvalli. The town is home to temples from the Chalukya era with Laxmi mandir with 4 Garbhagruha (sanctums). The Dwarpals of Laxmi or Durga feature two Vetals with some truly amazing hairstyles (including breaded hair). The other three Garbhagrihas are dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu, and Parvati. Forming a quadrilateral of brother-sister (Shiva-Laxmi and Vishnu-Parvati) and husband-wife(Shiva-Parvati and Vishnu-Laxmi) relationships. This temple has historical importance and was once considered the second most important place of worship in the Chalukya Empire after the Laxmi Temple at Kolhapur.

According to popular folklore, the name Hoysala empire itself comes from the story of warrior Sala saving a Jain guru Sudatta by striking a tiger dead. The Strike literally translates to “Hoy” in old Kanada and the emblem of the Hoysala empire commemorates the Slaying of Tiger by a Sala. This emblem is commonly seen in and around the Belure area. The town of Halebedu which again literally means old capital was indeed the old capital of the Hoysala empire before it was sacked by Malik Kafur by orders of Allaudin Khilji of Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century. What remains of Hoysala’s legacy is breathtaking never less. Based on the Dravidian style of architecture, Hoysala artisans perfected the intricate beadwork. Featuring intricate meshwork, hanging statues along with figures and pillars decorated with mesmerizing intricate carvings it is arguably far more detailed than the Vijaynagara style that followed it.

$logsTravelItemStart(Rajgad,19th Jun 21,20th Jun 21)$
Rajgad, formerly known as Murumdevs is one of the best-preserved forts in Maharastra and served as an early capital of the Maratha Empire for 26 years. I went on a night trek starting from the base of the fort towards the Palli gate. We reached there around 2:30 and then set up tents. There was supposed to be a sleeping break but 4 of us went on to trek towards the “Balekilla” (upper fort) and other parts till 4:30 am. Which was followed by a group hike to Sanjivani Machee to witness the sunrise. After that glorious encounter, we began a sleep-deprived and exhausted descent.

$logsTravelItemStart(Harishchandragad,13th Mar 21,14th Mar 21)$
Harishchandragad named after king Harishchandra was built during Kalachuri dynasty, who soon lost their territory to the Chalukyas of Vatapi.This fort also features the 6th highest peak Taramati (named after the wife of King Harishchandra) in Maharashtra state with height of 1,431m. There are references to this fort in Puranas and has a spiritual significance in Vaishnavism.
<br><br>
We left for the fort from Pune around 7:30 pm and reached the base at 3:30 am. After having night snacks, we started the ascend and reached the Taramati peak around 5:45 am. The ascent was non monotonous covering steep cliffs, forest paths, and plane ground. It became slightly challenging near the end but the view from the top was worth the trouble. We waited for the sunrise and then headed towards the Konkan Kada and nearby temples. Had breakfast at the fort and started our descent.

Ratangad was foggy, wet, and pleasant. An early morning trek on which we got lost near the end but managed to find our way back. These are the times I wished I didn’t have glasses. Started from Ratanwadi visited all four gates (Ganesh, Hanuman, Konkan, and Trimbak) and needle head along with some caves. Also rice paddies.
