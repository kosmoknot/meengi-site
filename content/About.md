<h2>About Me</h2>
Hello, I'm Anup and I maintain this website in my free time.<br> <br> I am working as R&D engineer and enjoy working on varied projects. Some of which you can find here. <br> <br>You could treat this as a
personal database of my life. This website is no way complete and shall never will be, please expect unfinished
notes and artwork here.

<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<h3>Why emphasise Free (as in Freedom)?</h3>
<h3>Why digital garden?</h3>
<h3>Why static website?</h3>
<h3>Why PixelArt?</h3>
I wanted to have almost all of the content on this site to be original or if not orignal then atleast transformed by me in some shape or form. Sadly I am really bad at art and PixelArt is easy. :-)
