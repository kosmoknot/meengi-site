$logsFoodItemStart(Omelette Pizza,18-04-2021,logs/omelete-pizza.jpeg,Half eaten cross section)$
Slapped a Spanish omelet on top of a pizza base with a layer of cheese and sauce in between them and viola!! The taste was nice and worth making again.

$logsFoodItemStart(Mushroom rice with tiger skinned eggs,10-05-2021,logs/rice.jpg,Rice was half cooked)$
Nothing fancy just boiled some eggs then fried them and added them to fried onions and mushrooms. Added cooked rice later. Tastes good worth making again eggs tasted especially good with mushrooms but adding potatoes was a bad idea. Potatoes don’t go well with mushroom rice and tiger-skinned eggs.

$logsFoodItemStart(Egg dosa,11-05-2021,logs/egg_dosa.jpg,Dosa with an egg on it)$
Egg dosa was one of my favorite hostel food and something which my mom can’t imagine. So here is it with some added paneer and slightly undercooked dosa dough. The recipe was simple enough with 3 layers of dosa, vegetables and paneer, and egg respectively.

Just sliced some vegies thin and tossed them on the ready-made pizza base with some grated mozzarella. Then it was just microwave preprogrammed settings to cook it well with some tomato sauce on top.
