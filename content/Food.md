$logsFoodItemStart(Mushroom rice with tiger skinned eggs,10-05-2021,/links/images/logs/rice.jpg,Rice was half cooked)$
Nothing fancy just boiled some eggs then fried them and added them into fried onions and mushrooms. Added cooked rice later. Tastes good worth making again eggs tasted especially good with mushrooms but adding potatoes was a bad idea. Potatoes don’t go well with mushroom rice and tiger-skinned eggs.

$logsFoodItemStart(Egg dosa,11-05-2021,/links/images/logs/egg_dosa.jpg,Dosa with an egg on it)$
Egg dosa was one of my favourite hostel food and something which my mom can’t imagine. So here is it with some added paneer and slightly undercooked dosa dough. The recipe was simple enough with 3 layers of dosa, vegetables and paneer and egg respectively.
