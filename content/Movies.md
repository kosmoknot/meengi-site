$logsMoviesItemStart(The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,Coen Brothers,English,2018,16-01-2021,9)$
Expectations are always high for a Cohen bros film, and this one does deliver on them. After watching a few of their films, the style becomes familiar. Ballad of Buster Scruggs has a lot of that absurd randomnesses, typical of Cohens, along with some heartfelt moments. There is much foreshadowing with poems like Ozymandias or with the clothing choices, but it doesn't always lead to expected outcomes. Starting with a fast-paced, upbeat, blood-filled, and satirical short, the movie slows down little by little, to a bloodless frightful conversation, while exploring a lot of things on the way. Nature is harsh, vast, and at its full glory, making characters appear more helpless than they should be.

$logsMoviesItemStart(Casablanca,Michael Curtiz,English,1942,18-01-2021,10)$
Even after so many years of movie-making, the narrative and style of Casablanca feel fresh. It truly does brings out the sentimentalist in everyone, no matter how skeptical you are about the movie. While being a romance, it still feels very unique due to its fast-paced and plot-heavy nature. It sneakily addresses many things like American isolationism, the moral dilemma of ignorance, and the centrality of virtues, while you're enthralled by brilliant performances.

$logsMoviesItemStart(Leave no trace,Debra Granik,English,2018,18-01-2021,9)$
This one is a highly underrated movie. The story is simple and mostly told visually. It creates tension by using previously shown information, character traits and manages to make even the most ordinary scene into an emotionally packed drama.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Life is beautiful,Roberto Benigni,Italian,1997,19-01-2021,9)$
Damn, that was something!
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(The Breakfast Club,John Hughes,English,1985,26-01-2021,8)$
Watched it in parts while traveling. This is a high school drama about a group of students self-reflecting and accepting themselves and each other. Would have enjoyed it far more if the context was Indian. Good to watch with teens.

$logsMoviesItemStart(White Tiger,Ramin Bahrani,Hindi/English,2021,28-01-2021,9)$
White Tiger by Arvind Adiga is one of the most upsetting books I have ever read (along with Dostoyevsky). The film captures that mood of discomfort and delivers an unfiltered Indian reality. Only if India could produce more of such original content (alas!). Everything from political references and vulgarity to villages and cites felt relatable while making them feel equally bastardized.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(There will be blood,Paul Thomas Anderson,English,2007,03-02-2021,10)$
Gonna do a rewatch.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Dhobighat - Mumbai diaries,Kiran Rao,Hindi,2021,03-02-2021,9)$
It is a criminally underrated film with something fresh to offer. It offers an unfiltered experience of Mumbai captured from multiple percpectives and artistic mediums, Aamir khan felt a bit out of place though.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Raging Bull,Martin Scorsese,English,1980,04-02-2021,8)$
Toxic masculinity!
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Soul,Pete Docter / Kemp Powers,English,2020,05-02-2021,6)$
Quite underwhelming.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Bombay,Mani Ratnam,Tamil,1995,06-02-2021,10)$
It is a true masterpiece with bold ambitions, stunning visuals, and eargasmic music of A.R. Rehman. The movie draws you in with traditional Bollywood (and Tollywood) tactics while setting up the next half with overt and covert symbolism. It is a rollercoaster ride of emotions, which handles all of them well while delivering a strong message.

$logsMoviesItemStart(Tanu weds Manu,Aanand L. Rai,Hindi,2011,07-02-2021,7)$
Liked it. Both Madhavan and Kangana were great and so was the story.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(The Aviator,Martin Scorsese,English,2004,12-02-2021,7)$
Focused on a multifaceted and talented personality who slowly but surely descends into madness.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days,Cristian Mungiu,Romanian,2007,12-02-2021,8)$
A slow-paced character study that steadily unfolds situations around protagonists beautifully. The movie takes you to the 1980s in Nicolae Ceaușescu’s Romania and explore's the era through 2 women trying to abort an unwanted pregnancy. The socialist dictatorship and the impact it had on the lives of common people are beautifully shown without saying much directly. The bleakness of the country is readily apparent, economic mismanagement and socialist weirdness stand out anytime an official with even a minute of authority speaks. The movie is also shot through the perspective of college youth, hopefully dreaming of better lives in a dystopian present, showing the contrast between their aspirations and reality.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Thappad,Anubhav Sinha,Hindi,2020,12-02-2021,8)$
This is a unique film that actually benefits from its typical Bollywood style by making it more approachable to its target audience. There is much drama that surprisingly serves a purpose in the film and weaves all the story threads together while delivering a coherent and meaningful narrative. Rather than taking a route of oversimplification into good vs evil categories, the movie introduces a large cast of side characters and explores nuances through their web of interconnected experiences and realizations while also making most of them relatable and likable. In a Bollywood mainstream filled to the brim with toxic masculinity, this feels like a fresh breeze of rational criticism of the status quo which is much welcome.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(What will people say,Iram Haq,Urdu Norwegian,2017,15-02-2021,10)$
One of the best movie I have ever seen in long time.

$logsMoviesItemStart(Lootcase,Rajesh Krishnan,Hindi,2020,21-02-2021,7)$
Nothing much to say.

$logsMoviesItemStart(The Darjeeling Limited,Wes Anderson,English,2007,22-02-2021,7)$
Felt a bit underwhelming maybe because of the familiarity.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Inception - Rewatch,Christopher Nolan,English,2010,18-03-2021,9)$
Could appreciate it more in the second watch. Also noticed some loopholes.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Black Friday,Anurag Kashyap,Hindi,2004,19-03-2021,10)$
This film is designed to make you face the uncomforting truth. From religious begotary, to police brutality it covers it all with great sensativity and care.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Whiplash,Damien Chazelle,English,2014,20-03-2021,10)$
Goddamit!! now diving into the world of Jazz.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Pianist,Roman Polanski,English,2002,20-03-2021,10)$
A touching story from WW2 whose emotional impact cannot be overstated.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(A Death in the Gunj,Konkona Sen Sharma,Hindi,2016,24-03-2021,9)$
Every aspect of this movie is refreshingly unique and innovative. It delivers its message effectively without making you feel like you’re receiving sermons and keeping you entertained through out its length.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Zack Snyder's Justice League,Zack Snyder,English,2021,25-03-2021,7)$
Outdid my expectations, but still felt unnecessarily long towards the end.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Sholay,Ramesh Sippy,Hindi,1975,28-03-2021,9)$
This movie has an immense influence on Bollywood and you easily notice that watching the movie, you can also notice the wild-west influence on the Sholay. Rather than just copy-paste wild west formula, Sholay adapted it for the Indian audience making it feel less gritty while adding a lot of comedy. Sholay is beautifully shot, has great dialogues, well-developed characters but most importantly it’s entertaining. For a 3hr long movie, it stays surprisingly fresh and bounces back and forth between moods while never losing the focus. It certainly is a masterpiece that can probably lose unnecessary songs and make Basanti less
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Isle of Dogs,Wes Anderson,English,2018,05-04-2021,8)$
Humor was spot on, animation was refreshing and loved all the little details which made dogs feel more relatable than humans.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Fantastic Mr. Fox,Wes Anderson,English,2020,10-04-2021,8)$
The look and feel was certainly unique, story was compelling and really well executed.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Hamilton Musical - Play ,Thomas Kail / Lin-Manuel Miranda,English,2020,29-03-2021,10)$
What a brilliant creation and I loved King George more than I should. The characterization was candid and more honest than I expected (thanks to the Hamiltons). I am not a big fan of rap, hip-hop, and blues but this musical took me by storm and delivered a mind-blowing experience.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Death to 2020 ,Al Campbell / Alice Mathias,English,2020,15-06-2021,8)$
A worthy documentry with a good mocking.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,Jason Woliner / Sacha Baron Cohen,English,2020,15-08-2021,10)$
Watching Borat and discovering the brilliance of Sacha Baron Cohen was marvelous. After watching Borat, all I could do was find more of that semi-staged comedy.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Barry Lyndon,Stanley Kubrick,English,1975,26-07-2021,9)$
Barry Lyndon is a slow paced movie where you can pretty much guess what is going to happen with some exceptions. The brilliance lies in the way those scenes unfold and the way they are depicted on screen. It makes you feel the stupidity of that time and wonder how will our current traditions and zeitgeist will look after 300 years of progress.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Reservoir Dogs,Quentin Tarantino,English,1992,10-10-2021,10)$
You can see the Tarantino style, sharp dialogues, constant underlying tension, masterful use of music, and explosive violence. It hardly feels like the first movie of a novice director but more like a magnum opus of a master. I can see that torture scene with that calm af song in my head around 14 months after watching the film. (Yes I am lazy, I upload stuff late on my site.)
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Sairat,Nagraj Manjule,Marathi,2016,??-10-2021,9)$
Damn this was amazing. Skillful subversion of tropes, gender roles, expectations. The complex social issues was presented in an approachable way. loved it. This reminded me of Bombay.
$logsItemEnd()$


$logsMoviesItemStart(Lage raho munna bhai,Rajkumar Hirani,Hindi,2006,30-09-2021,9)$
A much-needed Indian film that uses comedy to provoke Indians to think. In times when Godse is openly praised, it is refreshing to see the ideology of Gandhi brought to modern times. Gandhi is much criticized for not answering the question, of what to do in face of a violent oppressor who rejects Ahimsa. Should we die by surrendering or fight back and sacrificing our values? The film lightly touches on this question but it's not bothered with answering it. Munna bhai was not a philosophical film but it raised the same questions wrapped under comedy. You might hate Gandhi but this will surely make you think.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(Raman Raghav 2.0,Anurag Kashyap,Hindi,2016,30-09-2021,9)$
Didn't know about psycho Raman neither did I think that something so ugly and disgusting could be made in India. This one was filled with Vibhatsa rasa and it could have been better if not for the Indian censor board. Damn, I hate that board. Reminds me of Haramkhor but that film had a slightly sympathetic side. Raman Raghav sets out to remind you that there is always an ugly side inside us. And we should be careful to not let it out. Maybe not true of everyone but I surely felt that way.

$logsMoviesItemStart(8 miles,Curtis Hanson,English,2002,??-10-2021,8)$
This was far better than I thought it would be. I was waiting for a happy ending and things ending on a melancholic note was a pleasant surprise.

$logsMoviesItemStart(Sardar Udham,Shoojit Sircar,Hindi,2021,24-12-2021,10)$
This was something exciting; a very happy outlier avoiding glorification and showing what it took to protest, to challenge the system.

$logsMoviesItemStart(Spider-Man: No Way Home,Jon Watts,English,2021,??-12-2021,6)$
Pretty good nostalgia trip. Watched in the theater, and in retrospect Matrix 4 was a better choice.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(The Matrix Resurrections,Lana Wachowski,English,2021,??-12-2021,7)$
This didn't feel coherent. Agent Smith no longer feels menacing, the style feels off, fight scenes are comical at times, and rules are broken and changed. But I loved the self-aware moments.
$logsItemEnd()$

$logsMoviesItemStart(The Big Lebowski,Ethan Coen / Joel Coen,English,1998,10-01-2022,9)$
Not as dark as other Cohen brother movies but the parallels inside the movie were entertaining.

$logsMoviesItemStart(Watchmen,Zack Snyder,English,2009,14-01-2022,8)$
I love subversion of superhero genre and Watchmen is one of the best ones. I just watched an unnecessarily long cut. After watching the watchmen tv show I finally was ready to watch this 3.5 hrs long movie. The song at the starting was great. The gritty and dark ambiance was delightful.

$logsMoviesItemStart( Udta Punjab,Abhishek Chaubey,Hindi,2016,13-03-2022,8)$
The suspension of disbelief and a positive ending made it into a digestible movie but also a bit less enjoyable for me. Still pretty good overall.

$logsMoviesItemStart(The Handmaiden,Park Chan-wook,Korean,2016,31-7-2022,9)$
Erotic story filled with intrigue and solid direction and acting. It uses the erotica, nudity and gore to express themes much wider and leaves a lasting remark. Also the beads became bells and the snake got chopped down, not so overt yet not so subtle .

$logsMoviesItemStart(Awaara,Raj Kapoor,Hindi,1951,22-9-2022,8)$
The stark difference in the movie style felt jarring. But a nice movie which did the social commentary correctly and effectively. No wonder Raj Kapoor was popular.

$logsMoviesItemStart(Dogtooth,Yorgos Lanthimos,Greek,2009,22-9-2022,8)$
The Greek weird wave is an apt name. There are no names, explanations and payoffs. The world in movie is equally alien to us as our world is to them. But it still makes you think what our world might have been or maybe is in actuality or maybe heading towards.

Very honest and sincere portrait of a Marathi family. The unscripted nature and real relationships bring out some interesting dynamics. I also liked how she represents everyone in her family with respect and love while also showing their character flaws.

$logsMoviesItemStart(Pestonjee,Vijaya Mehta,Hindi,1988,10-3-2023,9)$
The film explores times gone by with a sense of longing and melancholy. It starts with a simple message of finding personal happiness and comes to it while teasing but never indulging in multiple cinema tropes. It's not only progressive for 1988 but even for today. This liberal undertone combined with parsi characters and decade of the 1950s creates a beautiful amalgamation that is truly riveting. I loved the theme, characters, direction, costumes and attention to detail. Everything about it feels well crafted to near perfection.
