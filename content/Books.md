$logsItemStart(Kingdom Manga,Yasuhisa Hara<br>Translated from Japanese to English<br>First Published: 2006<br>Read date: Ongoing<br>8/10)$
Based on ancient Chinese era warfare and politics, Kingdom is one of the best action war
manga out there. It focuses on the story of a peasant called Shin who wants so become a
general, which is hard to say the least. Kingdom is filled with stratergies and surprises
which are clever and intriguing. Politics adds an extra layer of complexity and makes the
world of Kingdom more believable.

$logsItemStart(One Hundred Years of Solitude,Gabriel García Márquez <br>Translated from Spanish to English <br>First Published: 1967<br>Read date: 27/11/2021<br>10/10)$
One of the most gripping books I have ever read. Takes you on a tour....

$logsItemStart(Norwegian Wood,Haruki Murakami<br>Translated from Japanese to English<br>First Published: 1987<br>Read date: ??/02/2021<br>8/10)$
Norwegian wood depicts depression, living with a depressed person and anxiety of student life, and many more themes in a very Murakami way. Even after reading all 389 pages, I still felt the book to be incomplete which is just what Murakami does to you.

$logsItemStart(South of the border west of the sun,Haruki Murakami<br>Translated from Japanese to English<br>First Published: 1992<br>Read date: ??/03/2022<br>9/10)$
A typical Murakami tale that surprisingly lacks fantastical elements. This book feels like it's firmely in the Murakami universe; along with the Norwegian woods and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle
<br><br>
Also I felt this book, while being very similar to the Norwegian wood, to be better than Norwegian wood.

$logsItemStart(Berserk,Kentaro Miura<br>Translated from Japanese to English<br>First Published: 1989<br>Read date: Ongoing??<br>10/10)$
RIP Miura. He died while I was about to finish the berserk and I was hoping for him to get better in order to finish it. No other death of a public figure comes close to the shock I felt. I still believe that Berserk is perfect as it is and ends on a satisfying note (Beware! I have grown too used to cliffhanger endings to movies.).
<br><br>
Berserk makes me feel things no other Manga has managed before and it is one of the bests for that very reason. I have read/watched a lot of fiction, and Berserk will still be on the top-tier list among all those mediums.

$logsItemStart(Sapiens,Yuval Harari<br>English<br>First Published: 2014<br>Read date: ??/05/2022<br>10/10)$
A surprisingly easy read for such an info-packed non-fiction book. It takes the reader on a journey through time with a scientific outlook. I feel very biased towards the book, for it affirms my biases of nihilism and absurdism. And it makes me happy knowing that the author probably shares them too.

$logsItemStart(Men without women,Haruki Murakami <br>Translated from Japanese to English<br>First Published: 2014<br>Read date: 25/06/2022<br>9/10)$
A collection of short stories that explore various emotions a man feels when there are women in his life, and when they are not. It is a skillful exploration that branches into a fresh new direction with each new short story.
<br><br>
I picked up the book during my Murakami binge because Drive my car was recently released (and I was excited to see Murakami's story transform from pages to a movie). Samsa in love is probably the most unique and touching story, but Men without women (the short story named after the title of book, or vice versa) was also quite enduring.
