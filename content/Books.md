$logsItemStart(Kingdom : Ongoing,Yasuhisa Hara<br>Translated from Japanese to English<br>8/10)$
Based on ancient Chinese era warfare and politics, Kingdom is one of the best action war
manga out there. It focuses on the story of a peasant called Shin who wants so become a
general, which is hard to say the least. Kingdom is filled with stratergies and surprises
which are clever and intriguing. Politics adds an extra layer of complexity and makes the
world of Kingdom more believable.

$logsItemStart(Men without women : 25/11/2022,Haruki Murakami <br>Translated from Japanese to English<br>9/10)$
A collection of short stories that explore various emotions a man feels when there are women in his life, and when they are not. It is a skillful exploration that branches into a fresh new direction with each new short story.

I picked up the book during my Murakami binge because Drive my car was recently released (and I was excited to see Murakami's story transform from pages to a movie). Samsa in love is probably the most unique and touching story, but Men without women (the short story named after the title of book, or vice versa) was also quite enduring.
