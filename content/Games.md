$logsGamesItemStart(Soma, Survival horror / First-person Adventure,2015,8)$
That was very horror and very adventure. The story was nice too, the jump scare which revealed a big secret was amazing. The horror is surreal and makes you contemplate many things including your existence, relationship between memory and self. Never felt truly frightened like the resident evil but still the core story was chilling on its own to leave a lasting impact.

Pretty good recreation of the Half-life with great graphics. Stays true to the experience of HL2 while expanding on the zen.  <br>The newly build levels of Xen were pretty good looking and slighly laggy due to optimisation issues. The visuals of zen are truly rewarding and the whole level feels at home.

The ambiance and music was amazing, with pretty challenging platforming.

This game forced me to search for better laptop. The open world aspect and fighting mechanics were nice.

A perfect weekend activity and my first card game. Also great replay value for such a small indie game. Oh my god this game keeps on going. Loved the story line and mini games.
