        <p><a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> was the first javascript library I ever worked with and It was
          gorgeous. Easy to program, plenty of resources, and examples with immediate visual results. I have used
          three.js to showcase my <a href="./3DModels.html">3D designs</a> and build a basic <a
            href="./Browser.html">3D navigator</a>. Here is a brief of that excursion.
          <br> <br><b>Setting up three.js:</b><br>
          I used <a href="https://atom.io/">atom</a> along with the <a
            href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/archive/master.zip">three.js master</a> to do initial setup on my
          windows 10 PC. Detailed information can be found <a
            href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Installation">here</a>. For windows, it was
          very easy. You just extract the three.js-master.zip add that path to your atom project path and you are ready
          to go.
          <br> <br> <b>First attempt:</b> <br> There are many <a
            href="https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_cloth">examples</a> on <a
            href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> website along with some <a
            href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene">basic documentation</a> .
          All these examples are also available in the master.zip along with other required resources like textures,
          fonts, and loaders. So basically choose your example make changes and debug until it runs. A live server <a
            href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server">package</a> on atom is very helpful for debugging as you
          just run your code on live server and use inspect option on your browser to debug your code.<br> <br>
