<h1>Enigma 2021: Prelims</h1>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<ol>
<li> May the duck / 10^100 / Utube guide you with your searches.
<li> We like apples and penguins but sometimes we prefer throwing them out of the window.
<li> We never went on a safari or tamed a red panda or been to an opera . Weâ€™re currently battling with the multicolored â€˜monsterâ€™ disk and would recommend the same if the others ditch you.
<li> No Hermione, itâ€™s neither LeviOsa, nor LevioSA. Itâ€™s â€˜wingardiumleviosaâ€™ plain and simple. No caps. No space.
<li> Paper and quills will help.
<li> Sometimes you need to download some plushy softwares.
<li> Order of court can be ignored but one shall not ignore the order of questions.
<li> Thou shall be ranked by your intellectual potential to score marks and submit fast. (No ranking of kings here everyone is a winner!)
<li> Thou shalt doubt our intellect by wondering how many answers a question has. Just like god there is only one true answer and that's ours.
<li> Thou shall submit on or before 8 pm. (Not anymore!ðŸ˜€)
<li> Only ONE submission per team. (Again, Not anymore!ðŸ˜€)
<li> Read the rules AGAIN
