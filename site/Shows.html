The influence of Naruto on Jujutsu Kaisen is readily apparent and it feels like a Naruto, ghostbuster hybrid. The plot is ok, fight scenes well-directed, no fillers, and the animation is beautiful. A worthy watch for Naruto, and Bleach fans.

One of the best psychological horror produced in any medium. The story is very well written which is complemented perfectly with the amazing animation and music. It successfully creates a creepy and freighting ambiance with a rewarding ending.

Influence of the Legend of Korra on animation style is readily apparent. The story is coherent even for people who havn't played the DOTA, but feels more impactful after playing the game.

Feels pretty grounded for a crime drama with redneck poppy farmers, Mexican drug cartel and money launderers. Each character is unique and has a satisfying story arc. BTW those children are pretty dope. PS. Last season didn't end well.

<ins>Killing Eve : Season 1-3</ins>
<br>English
<br>Released: 2018 - 2022
<br>Watch date: 19-02-2021
<br>8/10
</summary>
<p>
Phoebe Waller-Bridge has put together a weirdly unique combination of tropes in Killing Eve. It has assassins, MI6, too many lesbian and gay characters blended together in a stylized story which doesnâ€™t take itself too seriously. The humor, action, and romance all get better in 2nd season and again near the end of the 3rd season. 2nd season felt very similar to but far better than Hanibal and things took interesting turn in the 3rd season. High hopes for the 4th one. P.S. 4th was disappointing.

<ins>The Wire : rewatch</ins>
<br>English
<br>Released: 2002 - 2008
<br>Watch date: ??
<br>10/10
</summary>
<p>
I can't believe that I had missed the last season of the wire in my first watch. And trust me the last season delivered on all of that build-up, plotlines, character developments, and expectations. The wire is not about drugs or police it is about the city of Baltimore and its systemic flaws. The system is unwrapped layer by layer starting from drug gangs and police to politicians, schools, newspapers, and charities. People inside Baltimore are shaped by this ruthless and self-perpetuating cycle of misery and have learned to live with it. Everyone knows what needs to be done, some people know how to do those things and only a couple ever show the willpower to do so. The show is not entirely nihilistic rather it ends on a happy note with most of the main cast living their lives happily ever after but Baltimore remains the same; breeding more of the same. There hasn't been any other fictional show (that I have watched) more impactful and invigorating than wire and I love wire for that.

<p>
Season 1 started strong with a good story and pretty well-written characters. Music choices were damn nice throughout both seasons. I also liked the use of comedy which was used expertly. The second season felt like a money grab and the tease of the third season was the stupidest thing. Just finish the story within the season why use unnecessary cliffhangers which get resolved within 2 mins of S2? They got the tone right though.

Something new in vampire genre. Seeing another alucard after Helsing ultimate felt nice. Got progressively better as seasons progressed. Very light focus on powerups trainings but heavily features emotional states of characters, great gender balance and intresting side characters. Seems like there is no main plot which is executed quite well.

If the suit was cute af and actually funny. The nuance in story and underlying commentary on society, roles and place of law and lawyers is too well done. It engages even when it's questioning your beliefs sort of like the Parasite. My first Kdrama and fuking love it.
<br><br>
I keep coming back to this show, it has so much to offer. The point of view of woo makes you question the ordinary nature of your vantage point of the world. Maybe we will never see the world the way she does and billions of other humans and trillions of other living things.

This is a far far better version of expanse. The technical limitations are not even visible due to extremely well crafted plot lines. It's efficient, and compelling in the way the plot moves forward, the crew is always up to no good and there is always only a healthy amount of suspension of disbelief. Love the show, it's a beauty. It's like Cowboy bebop met heist movies met start wars. I can't stop loving it.
