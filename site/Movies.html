<ins>The Ballad of Buster Scruggs</ins>
<br>Director: Coen Brothers
<br>English
<br>Released: 2018
<br>Watch date: 16-01-2021
<br>9/10
</summary>
<p>
Expectations are always high for a Cohen bros film, and this one does deliver on them. After watching a few of their films, the style becomes familiar. Ballad of Buster Scruggs has a lot of that absurd randomnesses, typical of Cohens, along with some heartfelt moments. There is much foreshadowing with poems like Ozymandias or with the clothing choices, but it doesn't always lead to expected outcomes. Starting with a fast-paced, upbeat, blood-filled, and satirical short, the movie slows down little by little, to a bloodless frightful conversation, while exploring a lot of things on the way. Nature is harsh, vast, and at its full glory, making characters appear more helpless than they should be.

<br>Director: Michael Curtiz

<br>Watch date: 18-01-2021
<br>10/10
</summary>
<p>
Even after so many years of movie-making, the narrative and style of Casablanca feel fresh. It truly does brings out the sentimentalist in everyone, no matter how skeptical you are about the movie. While being a romance, it still feels very unique due to its fast-paced and plot-heavy nature. It sneakily addresses many things like American isolationism, the moral dilemma of ignorance, and the centrality of virtues, while you're enthralled by brilliant performances.

This one is a highly underrated movie. The story is simple and mostly told visually. It creates tension by using previously shown information, character traits and manages to make even the most ordinary scene into an emotionally packed drama.

<br>Released: 2021
<br>Watch date: 28-01-2021
<br>9/10
</summary>
<p>
White Tiger by Arvind Adiga is one of the most upsetting books I have ever read (along with Dostoyevsky). The film captures that mood of discomfort and delivers an unfiltered Indian reality. Only if India could produce more of such original content (alas!). Everything from political references and vulgarity to villages and cites felt relatable while making them feel equally bastardized.

<p>
It is a true masterpiece with bold ambitions, stunning visuals, and eargasmic music of A.R. Rehman. The movie draws you in with traditional Bollywood (and Tollywood) tactics while setting up the next half with overt and covert symbolism. It is a rollercoaster ride of emotions, which handles all of them well while delivering a strong message.

<br>Watch date: 12-02-2021

</summary>
<p>
A slow-paced character study that steadily unfolds situations around protagonists beautifully. The movie takes you to the 1980s in Nicolae Ceaușescu’s Romania and explore's the era through 2 women trying to abort an unwanted pregnancy. The socialist dictatorship and the impact it had on the lives of common people are beautifully shown without saying much directly. The bleakness of the country is readily apparent, economic mismanagement and socialist weirdness stand out anytime an official with even a minute of authority speaks. The movie is also shot through the perspective of college youth, hopefully dreaming of better lives in a dystopian present, showing the contrast between their aspirations and reality.

<br>Watch date: 12-02-2021
<br>8/10
</summary>
<p>
This is a unique film that actually benefits from its typical Bollywood style by making it more approachable to its target audience. There is much drama that surprisingly serves a purpose in the film and weaves all the story threads together while delivering a coherent and meaningful narrative. Rather than taking a route of oversimplification into good vs evil categories, the movie introduces a large cast of side characters and explores nuances through their web of interconnected experiences and realizations while also making most of them relatable and likable. In a Bollywood mainstream filled to the brim with toxic masculinity, this feels like a fresh breeze of rational criticism of the status quo which is much welcome.

<p>
This movie has an immense influence on Bollywood and you easily notice that watching the movie, you can also notice the wild-west influence on the Sholay. Rather than just copy-paste wild west formula, Sholay adapted it for the Indian audience making it feel less gritty while adding a lot of comedy. Sholay is beautifully shot, has great dialogues, well-developed characters but most importantly it’s entertaining. For a 3hr long movie, it stays surprisingly fresh and bounces back and forth between moods while never losing the focus. It certainly is a masterpiece that can probably lose unnecessary songs and make Basanti less

Barry Lyndon is a slow paced movie where you can pretty much guess what is going to happen with some exceptions. The brilliance lies in the way those scenes unfold and the way they are depicted on screen. It makes you feel the stupidity of that time and wonder how will our current traditions and zeitgeist will look after 300 years of progress.

You can see the Tarantino style, sharp dialogues, constant underlying tension, masterful use of music, and explosive violence.

<p>
A much-needed Indian film that uses comedy to provoke Indians to think. In times when Godse is openly praised, it is refreshing to see the ideology of Gandhi brought to modern times. Gandhi is much criticized for not answering the question, of what to do in face of a violent oppressor who rejects Ahimsa. Should we die by surrendering or fight back and sacrificing our values? The film lightly touches on this question but it's not bothered with answering it. Munna bhai was not a philosophical film but it raised the same questions wrapped under comedy. You might hate Gandhi but this will surely make you think.

Didn't know about psycho Raman neither did I think that something so ugly and disgusting could be made in India. This one was filled with Vibhatsa rasa and it could have been better if not for the Indian censor board. Damn, I hate that board. Reminds me of Haramkhor but that film had a slightly sympathetic side. Raman Raghav sets out to remind you that there is always an ugly side inside us. And we should be careful to not let it out. Maybe not true of everyone but I surely felt that way.

The bias was subtle but obvious. The arguments felt fun to listen to, though some of the mysogynist stuff was screaming at me from the screen. Good exercise at engaging the other side from across the ponds.

Erotic story filled with intrigue and solid direction and acting. It uses the erotica, nudity and gore to express themes much wider and leaves a lasting remark. Also the beads became bells and the snake got chopped down, not so overt yet not so subtle .

The stark difference in the movie style felt jarring. But a nice movie which did the social commentary correctly and effectively. No wonder Raj Kapoor was popular.

The Greek weird wave is an apt name. There are no names, explanations and payoffs. The world in movie is equally alien to us as our world is to them. But it still makes you think what our world might have been or maybe is in actuality or maybe heading towards.

The ambiance it created was nice. The concept of having non scientific entities to convey feeling instead of having them to explain the world seemed to be a unique theme to convey. Absolutely loved it in the theatre.
